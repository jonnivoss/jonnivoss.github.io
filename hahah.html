<h1>Mitochondrion: The powerhouse of a cell</h1>
<p>Mitochondria are small cells that live within cells of animals. They have their own DNA and even make their own proteins.</p>
<p>Mitochondria are split into different regions, here are some of the major regions:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Major Region</th>
    <th>Role</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Outer membrane</th>
    <th>It is here where smaller molecules can pass through and also has proteins called porins, which form channels to allow proteins to cross.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Intermembrane space</th>
    <th>The area between the inner and outer membranes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Inner membrane</th>
    <th>Holds proteins that serve multiple purposes. There are no porins in the inner membrane, which means that most molecules can't freely move through it, but they can cross the inner membrane in special membrane transporters. Most of the ATP is created here.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Cristae</th>
    <th>These are the folds of inner membrane and they increase the surface area of the membrane</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Matrix</th>
    <th>The space within the inner membrane, containing a lot of enzymes. Mitochondrial DNA is located here.</th>
  </tr>
